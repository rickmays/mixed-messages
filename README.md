# Mixed Messages
## Summary
This program is designed to log a message to the console that calls a random story and then grabs random words from arrays to fill in blanks. It is a Codecademy Full Stack Engineer course off-platform project. I partnered with [Matthew Mays](https://github.com/matthew-mays) for this project as it was the first partner project in the course. We were only given guidelines of the project, all of the code was written by us.
> **_NOTE:_**  Matthew served as project lead on this project and all github commits are in his repository for this project at [Mixed Messages](https://github.com/matthew-mays/mixed-messages).
## The Experience
- The lessons leading up to this off-platform project were about JavaScript fundamentals through arrays, loops, and if/switch statements.
- Another aspect this project was testing was our ability to work cooporatively with git/github. We were expected to work in the same repository and create branches to write and test our code.
- As this wasn't the most technically challenging project we've encountered, the real challenge of the project was ensuring that we performed the correct steps in order to push/pull to the same repository.
- The project goals were given to us in a Kanban style, however since they could only be moved in their interface and not edited, we took it a step further. Matthew developed a trello board for our project and transferred the goals into its own category on the page. This way we could edit the board and add cards to better keep track of parts that needed completion.
